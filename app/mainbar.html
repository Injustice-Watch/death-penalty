		<ul>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>4,711 </strong>inmates have been executed in states where the death penalty is no longer legal. </li>
			<li style="font-weight: 400;">Of nearly 16,000 total executions, only <strong>372</strong> inmates (2.36%) executed were women. </li>
			<li><strong>7,316 </strong>inmates (48%) executed were black. </li>
